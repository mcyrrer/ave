AVE
===

**AVE** is short for **Automated Verification Environment**, is a framework for test
automation and designed  by Sony Mobile. It is written for Linux Ubuntu 12+ in python 2.7
and consists of three parts:

- A set of modular APIs for efficient test automation that let test designers
  automate all sorts of tests, functional, power, performance, security and stability
  using various test equipment.
- A highly controlled test execution context to guarantee reliable test execution
  results, every time and regardless of location.
- A distributed resource management system that enables hardware sharing through
  a self-sustaining network of resource pools.


There’s extensive documentation available online at http://sonyxperiadev.github.io/ave/

The documentation can also be built locally by running `make html` from the
'documentation' directory (which does require sphinx), or read in their original
reST format.

AVE project was initiated by Fredrik Åkerblom and Klas Lindberg in 2012 when
they worked for Sony Mobile Communications. Since then, many joined in the
project to maintain and help grow the project. Although several of them
have left the organization and we have development footprint internally
available but not at GitHub,we would like to express our gratitude to them
for contribution to make this project publicly available:
